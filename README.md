# biostat777-project4-nsifnugel

**Hello!**

My name is Natalia Sifnugel and this repository holds the source code for JHSPH Biostat777 project 4. 

The goal of project 4 was to build an interactive dashboard using flexdashboard and shiny tools. I used data from the American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates 2020 to explore public transportation utilization in Boston, DC, New York, and Philadelphia. I also investigated the relationships between public transportation, income, and car ownership. 

Here is a link to my dashboard:<https://nsifnugel.shinyapps.io/transportation_dashboard>
