# biostat777-project4-nsifnugel

**Hello!**

My name is Natalia Sifnugel and this repository holds the source code for JHSPH Biostat777 project 4. 


The goal of project 4 was to build an interactive dashboard using flexdashboard and shiny tools. For my dashboard, I explored data from the American Community Survey (5-year 2016-2020) available through the census API. My analyses explore the use of public transportation across US cities and the relationships between public transportation, income, and car ownership. 

Here is a link to my dashboard:<https://nsifnugel.shinyapps.io/transportation_dashboard>
