# About {.tabset}

### Description 

Hello! My name is [Natalia Sifnugel](https://github.com/nsifnugel) and this is my interactive dashboard which explores public transportation use and related factors in Boston, DC, New York, and Philadelphia. Data for this analysis was provided by the [American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates 2020](https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5/variables.html), accessed using the tidycensus R package. 

The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize the total population which utilizes public transportation to get to work both at the city and zip code levels to make comparisons across and within cities. 

Along with public transportation as a means to get to work, I also looked at income and car ownership variables among those who use public transportation to get to work to understand which populations are more likely to use public transportation. 

These data were collected from the period of 2016-2020 and thus reflect life pre-pandemic before major shifts to remote work. When the next 5-year estimates come out, I am excited to see how the pandemic affected public transportation utilization and the distribution among income and car ownership groups.

# Data {.tabset}

### Description

Data for this analysis are from the American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates 2020 collected by the US Census Bureau. This dataset was chosen because it contains estimates at the zip code level, allowing for within city comparisons. To explore public transportation use, the variables I extracted and their uses are listed in the table below.
